Although it's not suprising given that the website was long deprecated, it's still a huge threat to the customers. VulnNet Entertainment states that such breach won't happen again, but can the customers feel safe? Maybe it's time for them move on? Let's hope that newest technology they implemented will increase the security, performance and overall functionality.

D-Link DSR-150, DSR-250, DSR-500, and DSR-1000AC and other VPN router models in the DSR Family running firmware version 3.14 and 3.17 are vulnerable to the remotely exploitable root command injection flaw.</p></div></section></div><div class="posts"><h1 class="content-subhead">Recent Posts</h1><section class="post"><header class="post-header"><img class="post-avatar" width="48" height="48" alt="Eric Ferraiuolo's avatar" src="/img/common/tilo-avatar.png"><h2 class="post-title">"There will always be insecure code" - Tommy DeVoss</h2><p class="post-meta">By <a class="post-author" href="#">Tilo Mitra</a> under <a class="post-category post-category-design" href="#" style="background-color: orange">Bug Bounty</a></p></header><div class="post-description"><p>‘As long as people are the ones writing code, there’s going to be insecure code’ – Tommy DeVoss on his post-jail bug bounty exploits. It’s definitely getting harder to find bugs, but since more and more companies and government organizations are doing bug bounty programs, there’s never a lack of bugs to find. I don’t think we’re ever going to have a shortage of bugs. As more and more people get into bug bounties, the competition’s definitely going to get harder, but I believe people will still be able to make a living from this if they are determined enough.</p></div></section><section class="post"><header class="post-header"><img class="post-avatar" width="48" height="48" alt="Reid Burke's avatar" src="/img/common/reid-avatar.png"><h2 class="post-title">Photos related to Security and Researchers</h2><p class="post-meta">By <a class="post-author" href="#">Reid Burke</a> under <a class="post-category post-category-pure" href="#">Photos</a></p></header><div class="post-description"><div class="post-images pure-g"><div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2"><a href="/img/common/finger.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" alt="Photo of someone working poolside at a resort" src="/img/common/finger.jpg" style="height: 450px; width: 550px"></a><div class="post-image-meta"><h3>Security Photos</h3></div></div><div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2"><a href="/img/common/hacker.jpg"><img class="pure-img-responsive" alt="Photo of the sunset on the beach" src="/img/common/hacker.jpg" style="height: 450px; width: 550px"></a><div class="post-image-meta"><h3>Researchers Photos</h3></div></div></div></div></section><section class="post"><header class="post-header"><img class="post-avatar" width="48" height="48" alt="Andrew Wooldridge's avatar" src="/img/common/andrew-avatar.png"><h2 class="post-title">Node.js vulnerabilities still present this times</h2><p class="post-meta">By <a class="post-author" href="#">Andrew Wooldridge</a> under <a class="post-category post-category-yui" href="#">Node.js</a></p></header><div class="post-description"><p>Security vulnerabilities are very common in Node.js. As developers, we keep using open source tools because we do not want to reinvent the wheel. This makes development easier and faster for us, but at the same time it introduces possible vulnerabilities to our applications. The best we can do for ourselves is to continually verify the packages we use because the more dependencies we use, the more room there is for more vulnerabilities. That is why it’s important to check for vulnerabilities as early as possible in your applications.</p></div></section><h1 class="content-subhead">Recent Posts</h1><section class="post"><header class="post-header"><img class="post-avatar" width="48" height="48" alt="Andrew Wooldridge's avatar" src="/img/common/reid-avatar.png"><h2 class="post-title">Payment Card Skimmer Group Using Raccoon Info-Stealer to Siphon Off Data</h2><p class="post-meta">By <a class="post-author" href="#">Reid Burke</a> under <a class="post-category post-category-js" href="#">APT</a></p></header><div class="post-description"><p> A cybercrime group known for targeting e-commerce websites unleashed a "multi-stage malicious campaign" earlier this year designed with an intent to distribute information stealers and JavaScript-based payment skimmers.
