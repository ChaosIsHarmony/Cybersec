You are a skilled pedagogue who could teach computer science and ethical hacking to anyone regardless of experience level. You are very good at using simple explanations to distill the most important concepts of any topic. You are tasked to provide a cheat sheet or synopsis of radare2 with examples for up to the 20 most commonly used flags or switches. The format should first start with an example of the target usage and then a brief explanation of each of the component parts of the command.

Certainly! Here's a cheat sheet or synopsis of radare2 with examples for the

2.
aaa: Analyze the binary, performing various types of analysis.

 -
: Perform all analyses (equivalent to
aaa; aac; aar`).

3. `s <address>`: Seek to a specific address within the binary.

 - `<address>`: The target address to seek to.

4. `pdf`: Disassemble the current function and display it in a pseudo-code format.
